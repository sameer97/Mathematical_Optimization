# Mathematical_Optimization

Contains few interesting real world optimization problems solved using **Python** and **Pyomo**.

## Problem Statements:
1. **Staff Allocation**: Allocate optimal number of staff for each weekday from a given set of employees such that each full-time employee works five consecutive days and then receive two days off.
2. **Floor Area Estimation**: Design an L-shaped house with as much square footage (floor area) as possible, within the limitations imposed by city codes and certain aesthetic considerations.
3. **Food Manufacturing**: Create an optimal multi-period production plan for a product that requires a number of ingredients â€“ each of which has different costs, restrictions, and features.
4. **Facility Location**: Figure out the optimal locations and treatment capacity of COVID-19 healthcare facilities by minimizing the cost of opening these temporary treatment facilities, as well as the total cost of patients driving from a county to the healthcare facility.
