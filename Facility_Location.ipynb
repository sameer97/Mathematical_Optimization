    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this problem is to figure out the optimal locations and treatment capacity of COVID-19 healthcare facilities by minimizing the cost of opening these temporary treatment facilities, as well as the total cost of patients driving from a county to the healthcare facility.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem considers 9 fictional counties in California, which are already equipped with COVID-19 treatment facilities and have an option to build additional temporary facilities at specified locations. The following details are provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It costs $500,000 to construct one temporary facility that can treat 100 patients\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It costs $5 extra in driving costs for an increase of 10 miles in distance to a treatment facility\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Existing facilities have a capacity of 80% of the forecasted demand, except for county 9, which is assumed to have excess capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance between each county, and each facility may be computed using their coordinates(which are in tens of miles).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*This problem is taken from Gurobi’s resources (https://www.gurobi.com/resource/covid-19-healthcare-facility-capacity-optimization/) which is based on a published paper (Katherine Klise and Michael Bynum. Facility Location Optimization Model for COVID-19 Resources. April 2020. Joint DOE Laboratory Pandemic Modeling and Analysis Capability. SAND2020-4693R.).*\n",
    "\n",
    "*This problem was solved as part of MILP Assignment in the course Mathematical Optimization with GAMS and Pyomo (Python) on udemy. (https://www.udemy.com/course/mathematical-optimization-with-gams-and-pyomo-python/)*\n",
